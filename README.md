# Project-2-DataCleaning-and-Analysis-Python

## Data Cleaning and Analysis with Python

### Task
To evaluate whether aggressive discounting is beneficial in the long run.

### Overview
Eniac's board noticed that the last quarter's increasing sales volume did not translate to higher revenue. Marketing believes that discounts are beneficial for customer acquisition and retention, while the board is concerned that aggressive discounts compromise their positioning as a premium quality provider. The data is compromised, so before analysis, data cleaning and quality assessment are necessary to make informed decisions.

### Context
Eniac is an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories. The board needs an immediate answer on whether to continue discounting. The challenge is to clean and assure data quality without losing significant information for decision-making.

### Approach
1. **Evaluate the Database:**
   - Clean data for unreadable entries, duplicates, and obvious errors.
   - Assess the remaining data for quality - remove compromised orders.
   - Note the constraints caused by the loss of data in decision-making ability.

2. **Basis of Decision Making:**
   - Compare recommended prices, product catalog, and actual sales.

3. **Note Recommendations:**
   - Suggest a course of action based on the analysis.
   - Include recommendations on how to improve data collection.

### Deliverables
- **5-Minute PowerPoint Presentation:**
  - Summarize findings and suggest a course of action.
  - Provide insights from data analysis.
  - Include Python code for transparency.

- **Python Code:**
  - Colab files for data cleaning, quality assessment, and analysis.
  - Utilize Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.
  - Share Jupyter Notebooks for easy reproduction and understanding.

### Colab Files
- **Data Cleaning Files:**
  - Separate files for each table to ensure organized cleaning.

- **Data Quality Files :**
  - Assess and ensure the quality of the data.

- **Data Analysis Files :**
  - Analyze the cleaned and quality-assured data.
  - Provide insights into pricing, product catalog, and actual sales.

### Skills & Tools
- **Data Cleaning & Quality Assurance:**
  - Identify and handle unreadable entries, duplicates, and errors.

- **Data Visualization & Storytelling:**
  - Use Seaborn and Matplotlib for insightful visualizations.
  - Create a narrative to tell the story behind the data.

- **Colab & Jupyter Notebook:**
  - Leverage Colab or Jupyter Notebooks for code transparency and reproducibility.

- **Python:**
  - Utilize Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.

### Recommendations
- Base decisions on a holistic analysis of recommended prices, product catalog, and actual sales.
- Consider the trade-offs between aggressive discounts and maintaining a premium image.
- Propose improvements in data collection for more accurate analyses in the future.

### Note
- The success of the decision-making process heavily relies on the quality and cleanliness of the data.
- Acknowledge limitations imposed by data loss during the cleaning process.

### Conclusion
The presented findings aim to provide the board with a clear understanding of the current situation, allowing for an informed decision on the continuation of aggressive discounting. The Python code and visualizations offer transparency and reproducibility, facilitating further exploration and analysis.
